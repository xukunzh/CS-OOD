# Object-Oriented Design and Analysis

## Overview
This course focuses on advanced object-oriented design and analysis principles using Java, building on concepts from earlier programming courses. It emphasizes inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism, alongside practical techniques for designing reusable and testable software. Key aspects include UML design notation, design patterns, performance analysis, and unit testing.

## Technical Highlights

- **Design Patterns**: Covered Command, Strategy, Template Method, and MVC patterns for building scalable, maintainable software.
- **UML & Graphical Notation**: Focused on creating visual models to represent system architecture, supporting better communication and design.
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Explored efficient use of Java collections (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashMap`) and algorithm optimization, focusing on real-time performance.
- **Testing**: Emphasis on unit testing with JUnit, ensuring software reliability with comprehensive coverage of test cases.
- **Java Concepts**: Deepened knowledge in Java I/O, generics, recursion, and CLI handling, while using Javaâ€™s powerful features like streams and lambda expressions.

## Key Projects

- **Rideshare Dispatch Simulator**: A final project that applied event-driven design, concurrency, and performance optimization in a real-time rideshare dispatch system.
- **Additional Projects**: Simulated various systems (e.g., real estate management, theater booking, email template processing) using object-oriented principles, emphasizing practical problem-solving skills.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Java**: Primary language for implementing object-oriented solutions.
- **JUnit**: Used for unit testing to ensure correctness and robustness of all projects.
- **UML**: Used for designing and visualizing system architecture.
- **Java Collections Framework**: Applied extensively for efficient data handling and storage.
- **Concurrency**: Managed multi-threaded operations, ensuring thread safety and optimal system performance.
